### Best Practices

- Use high-quality images (at least 1200px wide for primary images)
- Compress videos before upload (H.264 codec recommended)
- Name files clearly: `sculpture-front-view.jpg` not `IMG_1234.jpg`
- Include process documentation, not just final outputs
- Add captions/descriptions to explain what each file shows

## Managing Versions & Relationships

### Why Link Works?

Practice research outputs often evolve:
- A sculpture exhibited in multiple venues
- A performance with multiple instantiations
- An artwork adapted across media

Linking these relationships shows your research trajectory.

### Linking Previous Versions

If this Portfolio supersedes earlier work:

1. In the **Version Relationships** section, click **Add Previous Version**
2. Start typing the title of the earlier work
3. Select from the autocomplete suggestions
4. Click **Add**
5. Repeat for multiple previous versions

### Linking Performances or Exhibitions

If this work has been performed/exhibited:

1. First, create separate Portfolio works for each performance/exhibition
2. In each performance/exhibition Portfolio:
   - Fill in performance_date or exhibition_date
   - Fill in location details
   - Link back to the original work
3. In the original work Portfolio:
   - Add performance_id or exhibition_id linking to performance/exhibition records

### Version Type

Indicate what type of version this is:
- **Draft**: Work in progress
- **Final**: Completed work
- **Performance**: Performance instantiation
- **Exhibition**: Exhibition instantiation
- **Adaptation**: Adapted to different medium/format
- **Translation**: Translated to different language

## Cultural Context & TK Labels

### When to Use Cultural Context Fields

If your work:
- Originates from Indigenous communities
- Uses Traditional Knowledge
- Involves cultural protocols
- Has community-based ownership

**Important:** Consult with cultural authorities and community representatives before applying cultural metadata.

### Adding Cultural Context

**Cultural Origin**
- The cultural tradition(s) your work emerges from
- Example: "Māori (Ngāi Tahu iwi)"

**Cultural Community**
- Specific community/communities associated with the work
- Example: "Ōtākou Marae community"

**Indigenous Affiliation**
- Indigenous peoples or nations associated with the work
- Example: "Ngāi Tahu"

**Cultural Sensitivity Level**
- **Public**: Freely accessible
- **Community Only**: Restricted to community members
- **Restricted**: Limited access with permissions required
- **Sacred**: Highly restricted, requires cultural authority approval

### Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels

**What are TK Labels?**
Community-developed tools from [Local Contexts](https://localcontexts.org) for managing Indigenous intellectual property.

**Common TK Labels:**

- **TK A (Attribution)**: Corrects historical omissions, requires proper attribution
- **TK F (Family)**: Culturally sensitive, family-only access
- **TK MC (Multiple Communities)**: Multiple communities have interests
- **TK CO (Community Use Only)**: Restricted to community members
- **TK NC (Non-Commercial)**: Non-commercial use only
- **TK S (Seasonal)**: Seasonal or temporal restrictions
- **TK WG/MG (Women's/Men's General)**: Gender-restricted access
- **TK WR/MR (Women's/Men's Restricted)**: Gender-restricted, initiated members only

**How to Add TK Labels:**

1. Consult with cultural authorities about which labels apply
2. In the **Traditional Knowledge Labels** section, select applicable labels
3. Fill in **TK Label Text**: Explain what the label means for this specific work
4. Fill in **TK Attribution Requirement**: Specify how the work should be attributed

**Example TK Attribution Requirement:**
```
This work was created in collaboration with kaumātua from Ōtākou Marae.
Any use or citation must acknowledge: "Created with guidance from
kaumātua of Ōtākou Marae (Ngāi Tahu)" and include a link to this repository record.
```

### Access Restrictions

When TK Labels are applied, access restrictions are automatically enforced:
- **TK CO**: Only users with verified community affiliation can access
- **TK WG/MG**: Gender-based access control
- **TK WR/MR**: Gender + initiated member status required

Users must update their profile with cultural affiliations and other details to access restricted materials.

## Publishing & Sharing

### Visibility Settings

**Public**
- Visible to everyone
- Indexed by search engines
- Recommended for most research outputs

**Institution**
- Visible only to logged-in users at your institution
- Not indexed by search engines

**Private**
- Visible only to you and users you explicitly grant access to
- Use for works in progress or embargoed materials

### Embargo

Set an embargo if your work cannot be made public yet:

1. In the **Embargo** section, select **Apply Embargo**
2. Set **Embargo Release Date**
3. Select **Visibility After Embargo** (usually Public)
4. Fill in **Embargo Reason** (optional but recommended)
5. Save

The work will automatically become public on the release date.

### Sharing & Citation

After publishing, you can:

- **Copy permalink**: Permanent URL to share
- **Download citation**: BibTeX, RIS, EndNote formats
- **Get embed code**: Embed preview in your website
- **Export metadata**: Download metadata in various formats

**Example citation:**
```

3. Link to the previous version using **Previous Version** relationship
4. In the old version, add a note directing users to the new version

### Withdrawing Works

If you need to remove a work:

1. Contact your repository administrator
2. Explain why the work should be withdrawn
3. Administrator will review and process the request

**Note:** Withdrawn works retain their persistent identifier and show a "Withdrawn" notice, preserving citation integrity.
